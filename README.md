# About
This is our entry for the 2017 GovHack Competition!

The EweTube website provides you with a seamless way of inspecting localised agricultural data. We showcase beautiful charts based on the data you have queried using our simple intuitive web interface, and then provide you with a stunning Google Slideshow presentation which presents the data you have queried!
